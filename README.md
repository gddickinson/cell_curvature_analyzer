## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: View original images, binary masks, and analysis overlays side-by-side
- **Curvature Analysis**: Calculate three types of curvature (sign, magnitude, and normalized)
- **Intensity Correlation**: Analyze the relationship between curvature and fluorescence intensity
- **Temporal Analysis**: Track changes across frames and correlate with previous frames
- **Edge Movement Detection**: Classify cell edge regions as extending, retracting, or stable
- **Multi-tab Interface**: Dedicated views for different analysis aspects

- View curvature and intensity profiles in the analysis tab
- Explore correlations by movement type in the correlation tab
- Compare current frame with previous/random frames in the temporal tab

### Exporting Data

1. Go to the **Export Results** tab
2. Select the types of data to export (images, raw data, statistics, figures, report)
3. Choose an export directory
4. Click **Export Data**

## Analysis Methodology

### Curvature Measurement

The application calculates three types of curvature at equidistant points along the cell edge:

1. **Sign Curvature (-1 or 1)**: Indicates whether the curvature is inward (negative) or outward (positive)
2. **Magnitude Curvature (â‰¥0)**: The absolute strength of the curvature
3. **Normalized Curvature (-1 to 1)**: Combines direction and magnitude

### Intensity Sampling

For each point along the cell edge:
1. An inward normal vector is calculated
2. A rectangular sampling region extends into the cell
3. The mean fluorescence intensity within this region is measured

### Edge Movement Analysis

The application classifies cell edge movement into three categories:
- **Extending**: Cell growth/protrusion (blue in visualizations)
- **Retracting**: Cell shrinkage/retraction (red in visualizations)
- **Stable**: Minimal net movement (gray in visualizations)
